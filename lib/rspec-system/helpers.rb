# This module contains the main rspec helpers that are to be used within
# rspec-system tests. These are the meat-and-potatoes of your system tests,
# and in theory there shouldn't be anything you can't do without the helpers
# here.
#
# These helpers in particular are core to the framework. You can however
# combine these helpers to create your own more powerful helpers in rspec
# if you wish.
#
# The helpers themselves are split into two main groups, Queries:
#
# * +system_node+ - queries and returns node information
#
# And Actions:
#
# * +shell+ - runs a command on a node
# * +rcp+ - remote copies to a node
#
# @example Using node in your tests
#   describe 'test running' do
#     it 'do something if redhat' do
#       if node.facts['operatingsystem'] == 'RedHat' do
#         shell 'cat /etc/redhat-release'
#       end
#     end
#   end
# @example Make your own helper
#   describe 'my own helper' do
#     def install_puppet
#       facts = node.facts
#
#       # Grab PL repository and install PL copy of puppet
#       if facts['osfamily'] == 'RedHat'
#         shell 'rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/5/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-5-6.noarch.rpm'
#         shell 'yum install -y puppet'
#       elsif facts['osfamily'] == 'Debian'
#         shell "wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-#{facts['lsbdistcodename']}.deb"
#         shell "dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-#{facts['lsbdistcodename']}.deb"
#         shell 'apt-get update'
#         shell 'apt-get install -y puppet'
#       end
#     end
#
#     it 'test installing latest puppet' do
#       install_puppet
#       shell 'puppet apply --version' do |r|
#         r.exit_code.should be_zero
#         r.stdout.should =~ /3.1/
#         r.stderr.should be_empty
#       end
#     end
#   end

  # @!macro shell_method

  # Runs a shell command on a test host.
  #
  # When invoked as a block a result hash is yielded to the block as a
  # parameter. Alternatively the result hash it is returned to the caller.
  #
  # If you have only provided 1 node in your nodeset, or you have specified a
  # a default you can avoid entering the name of the node if you wish. The
  # method for simplicity can accept a string instead of an options hash
  # and it knows to default everything else.
  #
  # The underlying implementation is actually performed by the particular
  # node provider, however this abstraction should mean you shouldn't need
  # to worry about that.
  #
  # @api public
  # @api public
  # @overload $0(options)
  #   @param options [Hash] options for command execution
  #   @option options [String] :command command to execute. Mandatory.
  #   @option options [String] :c alias for :command
  #   @option options [RSpecSystem::Node] :node (defaults to what was defined
  #     default in your YAML file, otherwise if there is only one node it uses
  #     that) specifies node to execute command on.

  # @yield [result] yields result when called as a block
  # @yieldparam result [RSpecSystem::Helpers::Shell] result of run
